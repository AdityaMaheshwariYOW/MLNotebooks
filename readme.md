# Machine Learning Course Content

This repo contains the Rmd notebooks used to teach the "machine learning course" at the Carleton University Global Academy. 

Typically this is a 4 week course with lectures 5 days a week for 2 hours each. Exercises are mostly done in class!

The Tensorflow content from these notebooks should be run carefully as it needs the right type of machine.
